## The Project-Based Learning Approach
Project Based Learning is a learning approach in which students gain concepts, knowledge and skills by working on a real project to investigate and respond to an authentic, engaging, and complex question, problem, or challenge.

## What is DevHugs?
[DevHugs](https://DevHugs.net) provides a curated list of project tutorials in which learners build an application from scratch. These are divided into different categories, namely, web development, mobile development, game development, machine learning, deep learning and artificial intelligence.

The list has project tutorials on many in-demand languages and technologies including:
 

 - ReactJS, NodeJS, VueJS, Angular, Django for [Web Development](https://devhugs.net/learn/web-development)
 - Flutter, React Native, Swift, Java, Kotlin for [Mobile App Development](https://devhugs.net/learn/mobile-development)
 - C#, .NET Core, Unity, JavaScript for [Game Development](https://devhugs.net/learn/game-development)
 - Python, TensorFlow, Numpy, Pandas, OpenCV, Keras, PyTorch for [Machine Learning and Artifical Intelligence](https://devhugs.net/learn/machine-learning-and-ai)

This project is community-driven. Feel free to open an issue (or even better, send a Pull Request) for expanding this list of awesome project tutorials. Contributions are very much welcome.
