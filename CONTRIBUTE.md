1. Ensure the project tutorial to be added doesn't already exist and it is of good quality (code quality, project scope & project relevance).
2. Update the [data.js](https://github.com/Xtremilicious/ProjectLearn-Project-Based-Learning/blob/master/data.js) file. Project links must be pointing straight to the tutorials, no URL shorteners.
